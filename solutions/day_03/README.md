### Work to do:

In order to find the sum of the Multiplications:

* Parse the data file, which is in plain text format

* Find sequences where `mul()` contains multiple numbers separated by commas, such as `mul(1,2)`

    * (ignore any partial, invalid, or corrupted `mul()` expressions!)

* Interpet the numbers as integers

* Multiple the numbers in the `mul()` expression together to get a result (also an integer)

* Sum all of the results to get the answer (also an integer)
